# FEED[frame]
Share a photo frame feed between people using easy sharing ðŸ‘´ðŸ§“

### Concept
An old display can be used as a social photo frame using low interaction that would be suitable for elderly people as much as friends connected via Discord sending a URL to add to the photo frame.

New photos added to the stream will immediately appear on all connected clients. The only exception would be someone who has manually set a picture will only receive a notification that new photos have arrived encouraging them to go live again.

The user interface should be touch first. There must be plenty of people with old tablets looking to make some use of them. Combine this with a smart plug keeping it charged intelligently and it becomes more viable to keep cycling the battery.

### Technology
No app is required. Just a link to a web application and put it in full-screen. Anyone with the link to the feed can view it and will receive new photos when the feed updates.
